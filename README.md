# SNHU_CS_210 Journal

SUMMARY:
This project is a banking app that allows the user to view a projection of their potential return on investment (ROI). The user must input the amount of their initial investment, the amount of their recurring monthly deposits, what ROI percentage that they want, as well as the duration of the investment (in months). After this information is gathered, the program will then calculate the appropriate values. Two tables will be output to the user, one displaying their ROI with recurring deposits, and the other displaying their ROI without recurring deposits.

WHAT DID YOU DO WELL?
One thing I believe I did particularly well was implementing input validation into my program. While there may still be an edge case I did not take into consideration, I was quite thorough when adding input validation into my project.

WHERE COULD YOU ENHANCE YOUR CODE?
One area in which I could enhance my code would be in the output for the tables where the program is being ran. I encountered an issue where the spacing on one of the columns would be off after a certain amount of rows were outputted.  

WHICH PIECES OF CODE WERE MOST DIFFICULT TO WRITE?
I struggled with implementing accessors and mutators to my class the most. It was my first time implementing them into a project so there was certainly some learning pains to overcome throughout this process. I was able to overcome this struggle by referencing the cplusplus website for additional help with syntax and tutorials. 

WHAT SKILLS FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE PARTICULARLY TRANSFERABLE?
I believe the most valuable skill I enhanced during this project would be my ability to reference online material for help regarding concepts I do not fully understand. Being able to easily access information is very valuable as there is a ridiculous amount of information related to programming, and as such it will be impossible to fully retain all of it. 

HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS PROGRAM MAINTAINABLE, READABLE AND ADAPTABLE?
I pursued these values by making sure to add comments throughout my program, as well as do my best to follow best practices for naming conventions.
